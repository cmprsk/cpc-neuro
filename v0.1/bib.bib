Variable locations, extent of resection, postoperative neurodiagnostic evaluation, and histology have confounded therapy and outcome. OBJECTIVES: To investigate disease control and survival after surgery. METHODS: A prospective natural history trial from 1991 to 1996 produced a subset of patients with low-grade gliomas managed by primary surgery and subsequent observation. Patients were evaluable if eligibility, tumor location, and extent of resection were confirmed by pathological diagnosis, preoperative and postoperative imaging, and the surgeon's report. Primary end points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and postprogression survival. RESULTS: Of 726 patients enrolled, 518 were fully evaluable for analysis. The 5- and 8-year OS rates were 97% $\pm$ 0.8% and 96% $\pm$ 0.9%, respectively, and PFS rates were 80% $\pm$ 1.8% and 78% $\pm$ 2.0%. In univariate analyses, histological type, extent of residual tumor, and disease site were significantly associated with PFS and OS. In multivariate analysis, gross total resection (GTR) without residual disease was the predominant predictor of PFS. In patients with limited residual disease, 56% were free of progression at 5 years. CONCLUSION: GTR should be the goal when it can be achieved with an acceptable functional outcome. The variable rate of progression after incomplete resection highlights the need for new predictors of tumor behavior.},

abstract ={Purpose The use of radiotherapy in pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) is controversial, especially for young patients. We conducted a phase II trial of conformal radiation therapy (CRT) to estimate disease control by using a 10-mm clinical target volume (CTV) margin.Materials and Methods Between August 1997 and August 2006, 78 pediatric patients with LGG and a median age of 8.9 years (range, 2.2 to 19.8 years) received 54 Gy CRT by using a 10-mm CTV and by targeting with systematic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) registration. Tumor locations were diencephalon (n = 58), cerebral hemisphere (n = 3), and cerebellum (n = 17). Sixty-seven patients had documented or presumed WHO grade 1 tumors, 25 patients had prior chemotherapy, and 13 patients had neurofibromatosis type 1.Results During a median follow-up of 89 months, 13 patients experienced disease progression. One patient experienced marginal treatment failure, eight experienced local failures, and four experienced metastatic failure. The mean and standard error 5- and 10-year event-free (87.4% ± 4.4% and 74.3% ± 15.4%, respectively) and overall (98.5% ± 1.6% and 95.9% ± 5.8%, respectively) survival rates were determined. The mean and standard error cumulative incidences of local failure at 5 and 10 years were 8.7% ± 3.5% and 16.4% ± 5.4%, respectively. The mean and standard error cumulative incidence of vasculopathy was 4.79% ± 2.73% at 6 years, and it was higher for those younger than 5 years of age (P = .0105) at the time of CRT.Conclusion This large, prospective series of irradiated children with LGG demonstrates that CRT with a 10-mm CTV does not compromise disease control. The results suggest that CRT should be delayed in young patients to reduce the risk of vasculopathy.},

abstract ={Purpose We conducted a prospective trial to evaluate late effects in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) treated with conformal radiation therapy (CRT).Patients and Methods Between August 1997 and August 2006, 78 pediatric patients with LGG (mean age, 9.7 years; standard deviation, ±4.4 years) received 54 Gy of CRT with a 10-mm clinical target volume margin. Tumor locations were diencephalon (n = 58), cerebral hemisphere (n = 3), and cerebellum (n = 17). Baseline and serial evaluations were performed to identify deficits in cognition, endocrine function, and hearing. Deficits were correlated with clinical factors and radiation dose within specific normal tissue volumes.Results Cognitive effects of CRT through 5 years after CRT correlated with patient age, neurofibromatosis type 1 status, tumor location and volume, extent of resection, and radiation dose. The effect of age exceeded that of radiation dose; patients younger than 5 years experienced the greatest decline in cognition. Before CRT, growth hormone (GH) secretion abnormality was diagnosed in 24% of tested patients, and 12% had precocious puberty. The 10-year cumulative incidence of GH replacement was 48.9%; of thyroid hormone replacement, 64.0%; of glucocorticoid replacement, 19.2%; and of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy, 34.2%. The mean ± standard errors of the cumulative incidence of hearing loss at 10 years did not exceed 5.7% ± 3.3% at any frequency.Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest series of prospectively followed children with LGG to undergo irradiation. Adverse effects are limited and predictable for most patients; however, this study provides additional evidence that CRT should be delayed for young patients and identifies the potential benefits of reducing radiation dose to normal brain.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low grade gliomas arise in all CNS-locations and age groups, chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors occur especially in young children. Early radiotherapy (RT) shall be deferred by chemotherapy (CT) within the concept of the HIT-LGG 1996 study, offering a comprehensive treatment strategy for all age groups. PATIENTS: 198 of 905 protocol patients (21.9 %) had a chiasmatic (34), chiasmatic-hypothalamic (144) or hypothalamic (20) primary tumor, median age at diagnosis 3.6 years (0.2-16.3 y.), 54 had neurofibromatosis (27.3 %), 108 female (54.5 %). 98 children had severe visual impairment as their first symptom. The initial neurosurgical intervention resulted in 5 complete, 26 subtotal, 45 partial resections, 67 biopsies; 55 children had a diagnosis on the basis of neuroradiologic findings. Histology showed 132 pilocytic astrocytoma I degrees , 6 astrocytoma II degrees /nos and 2 DIGG/DIA I degrees (3 not known). RESULTS: 82 children were treated at diagnosis, 68 upon clinical or radiological progression following observation times of 3.0 to 115.0 months. RT: 27 children received conventional (18) or interstitial (8) RT (1 not documented) at a median age of 7.3 years; 7 tumors went into further progression. At a median observation time of 50.1 months 21 tumors are stable, 3 regressive (2 not evaluable, 1 death). CT: 123 children received vincristin/carboplatin at a median age of 3.7 years. 105/123 achieved CR/PR/SD. 44/123 tumors were progressive after median 22.5 months, 37 with a chiasmatic-hypothalamic primary, 16/44 were irradiated. At a median observation time of 44.7 months 2 children are in complete remission, 92 tumors are stable, 8 regressive, 9 progressive. 4 children died, 8 are not evaluable. At 60 months overall survival of the cohort is 0.93; PFS of the CT-group is 0.61, the RT-free survival 0.83. Within the CT-group children with an age at diagnosis < 1 year and non-pilocytic histology are at increased risk for early progression. Causative factors cannot be defined, yet. CONCLUSION: Within the comprehensive treatment strategy for low grade glioma HIT-LGG 1996 chemotherapy is effective to delay the need for early radiotherapy in chiasmatic-hypothalamic glioma. More effective reduction of the risk for progression has to be sought for young children < 1 year.},

	Abstract = {Between March 9, 1984 and January 29, 1992, 42 children with newly diagnosed symptomatic or previously diagnosed progressive low-grade gliomas received outpatient chemotherapy as their primary treatment. This study was a single arm, phase II trial designed to estimate the time to tumor progression and toxicity of this regimen. Procarbazine, 6-thioguanine, and dibromodulcitol were given before lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine was given 1 and 3 weeks after CCNU. Patients were treated for six treatment cycles or until the tumor progressed, whichever came first. Twenty-three patients had juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, 11 had astrocytomas, one had oligodendroglioma, one had ganglioglioma, and six had radiographically diagnosed low-grade gliomas. The mean age of the patients was 5 years (median, 3 years). The median time to treatment failure was 132 weeks (95% confidence interval: 106, 186 weeks). Only eight patients have died the estimated 5-year survival rate is 78% (95% confidence interval, 60% 87%). There were two episodes of grade 4 neutropenia, and three episodes of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. This regimen was safe, able to be delivered in the outpatient setting, and produced prolonged periods of disease stabilization in children with low-grade gliomas.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to avoid radiotherapy and to induce an objective response in children with low-grade glioma (LGG) using a simple chemotherapy regimen based on cisplatin and etoposide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four children (median age, 45 months) with unresectable LGG were treated with 10 monthly cycles of cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 3) and etoposide (150 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 3). Tumor originated in the visual pathway in 29 patients, in the temporal lobe in two, in the frontal lobe in two, and in the spine in one. Eight children were affected by neurofibromatosis type 1. Objective tumor response and toxicity were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic and functional tests at 3-month intervals. RESULTS: An objective response was obtained in 24 (70%) of 34 patients, whereas the others had stable disease. None of the children were electively irradiated. In 31 previously untreated children, overall survival was 100% and progression-free survival was 78% at 3 years, with a median follow-up of 44 months. Acute toxicity was unremarkable; 28% patients evaluated for acoustic neurotoxicity revealed a loss of perception of high frequencies. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin and etoposide combined treatment is one of the most active regimens for LGG in children and allows avoidance of radiotherapy in the vast majority of patients.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the activity of carboplatin and iproplatin in children with progressive or recurrent brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was designed to evaluate the activity of these agents and to compare the toxicities associated with their use. Treatment consisted of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 at 4-week intervals or iproplatin 270 mg/m2 at 3-week intervals. RESULTS: The major toxicity observed was myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia, for both agents. Ototoxicity (grade 1 or 2) was seen in 2.5% of patients treated with carboplatin and 1.3% of patients treated with iproplatin. The majority of patients with low-grade astrocytic neoplasms treated with carboplatin (nine of 12 patients) or iproplatin (eight of 12 patients) demonstrated tumor response or prolonged stable disease that persisted off-therapy. The duration of stable disease produced by carboplatin was particularly striking, ranging from 2 months to 68 + months (median, 40 + months). Neither drug demonstrated appreciable activity in the treatment of medulloblastoma (two of 26 responses to carboplatin, one of 14 responses to iproplatin), ependymoma (two of 17 responses to carboplatin, none of seven responses to iproplatin), high-grade glioma (two of 19 responses to carboplatin, one of 14 responses to iproplatin), or brain-stem tumors (one of 23 responses to carboplatin, none of 14 responses to iproplatin). CONCLUSION: Carboplatin is active against low-grade gliomas. Further evaluation of the role of carboplatin in the preirradiation treatment of children with low-grade gliomas of the optic pathway is currently underway in a clinical trial.},

abstract ={Low-grade glioma (LGG) in children and adolescents have a spectrum of presentations determining various therapies. The SIOP-LGG 2004 strategy recommends observation following complete resection or after incomplete surgery without severe or threatening symptoms, and age-stratified radio- and chemotherapy for patients with severe symptoms or later progression. The intensity of induction chemotherapy (2 vs. 3 drugs) is the randomised study question for sporadic LGG (NF1-ve). Multicentre radiology and pathology reviews are integrated. Of 3206 patients registered from 01.04.2004 to 30.01.2012 in 12 countries, 1786 were observed, 1133 treated (35.5%), 66 in evaluation (221 incomplete data), 1540/2985 are males, 100/2985 disseminated, 453/2985 NF1 + ve. Main tumour localisation: supratentorial midline (40%), main histology: pilocytic astrocytoma (46%). 32% of tumours are diagnosed radiologically. Patients under observation have more frequently initial complete resection (33%), in cerebral/cerebellar locations (60%), with pilocytic histology (51%), but with diffuse glioma (3.8%) and glioneuronal tumours (6.9%), as well. They had radiologic diagnosis in 14%. Visual impairment, focal neurologic deficits and tumour progression constitute the main indication for (age-stratified) non-surgical treatment. Patients in the chemotherapy group (n = 930) had a median age of 3.8 years, 26% were NF1 + ve, and treatment started within 3 months in 60%. Radiotherapy was used in 181 patients (median age 10.1 years), 4% were NF1 + ve, 38% started treatment <3 months. Distribution of tumour sites, extent of resection and histologies was comparable in the treatment-groups. 486 sporadic/NF1-ve patients were randomised, 15% aged <1 year, 39% with visual pathway tumours, 14% disseminated. Induction treatment was completed comparably in both arms. 5-year overall-survival is 99.3% for children being observed and 85.8% for those selected for non-surgical treatment. This European trial for childhood LGG providing therapy-guidelines as well as randomisation for a subgroup has high patient recruitment and adherence to the multi-disciplinary strategy including age stratification. Data quality control measures are in progress.},

abstract ={Purpose Surgery is curative therapy for pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) in areas of the brain amenable to complete resection. However, LGGs located in areas where complete resection is not possible can threaten both function and life. The purpose of this study was to compare two chemotherapy regimens for LGGs in children younger than age 10 years for whom radiotherapy was felt by the practitioner to pose a high risk of neurodevelopmental injury.Patients and Methods Previously untreated children younger than age 10 years with progressive or residual LGGs were eligible. Children were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin and vincristine (CV) or thioguanine, procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (TPCV). Children with neurofibromatosis are reported separately.Results Of 274 randomly assigned patients who met eligibility requirements, 137 received CV and 137 received TPCV. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all eligible patients were 45% ± 3.2% and 86% ± 2.2%, respectively. The 5-year EFS rates were 39% ± 4% for CV and 52% ± 5% for TPCV (stratified log-rank test P = .10; cure model analysis P = .007). On multivariate analysis, factors independently predictive of worse EFS and OS were younger age and tumor size greater than 3 cm2. Tumor location in the thalamus was also associated with poor OS.Conclusion The difference in EFS between the regimens did not reach significance on the basis of the stratified log-rank test. The 5-year EFS was higher for TPCV on the basis of the cure model analysis. Differences in toxicity may influence physician choice of regimens.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology of primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) in pediatric patients from a Brazilian oncology institute. We retrospectively analyzed 741 charts (415 males and 326 females) of patients under 21 years of age who were diagnosed with a CNS tumor. The analysis included patients from 1989 to 2009 and was performed using the World Health Organization criteria. We evaluated the distribution of age, sex, topography, clinical symptoms, symptom intervals, and classification of the tumors. Patients with clinical/radiologic diagnoses were included. Seven hundred forty-one patients with tumors in the CNS were reviewed, and 83% of the patients presented a histologic diagnosis. Males (56%) were more prevalent than females. In children under the age of 1 year, the supratentorial compartment was the predominant region involved (62.0%). Astrocytoma was the most frequent tumor type (37.0%), followed by medulloblastoma (13.6%), craniopharyngioma (10.5%), and ependymoma (6.8%). Headaches were the most common symptom, and the symptom intervals varied from 1 to 5010 days. Approximately 4% of the patients had associated genetic syndromes. Although it was not a population study and selection bias may have occurred, this study supplies important epidemiologic data from an emerging country in which population studies are rare.},

	Abstract = {OBJECT: The purpose of this study is to determine the epidemiology of tumors of the nervous system diagnosed according to the WHO 2000 classification in a single Brazilian institution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: One thousand one hundred ninety-five tumors in children between 0 and 21 years of age diagnosed between 1974 and 2003 were classified according the sex, topography, and age distribution. RESULTS: In all ages, males were slightly more affected. In the first 2 years, the prevalence for boys was higher (68.3%). In the whole series, 58.7% were supratentorial, 31.4% infratentorial, and 9.9% spinal (44% intra- and 56% extramedullary). Among these latter, ependymomas and schwannomas were the most frequent. In the cerebral compartment, pilocytic astrocytomas were the single most frequent tumors (18%), followed by diffuse astrocytomas (14%), medulloblastomas (11%), and craniopharyngiomas (11%). In the posterior fossa, there was an even distribution among medulloblastomas and pilocytic astrocytomas, but the former was much more frequent in the first 2 years of age. High-grade (III and IV) diffuse astrocytomas were slightly more frequent than low grades (II), and this difference becomes more evident as the child grows older. Due to the new development of the surgery of epilepsy, the frequency of neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors is increasing (8%). CONCLUSION: Classified according to the latest WHO classification, by a single neuropathologist in a single institution, this large series of pediatric neurological tumors may reflect fairly well their real incidence. Our results obtained in a developing country do not differ substantially from other similar series reported in the literature from the First World.},

abstract ={Objective The primary objective of this study was to decrease the late effects of prophylactic radiation without reducing survival in standard-risk childhood medulloblastoma.Patients and Methods Inclusion criteria were as follows: children between the ages of 3 and 18 years with total or subtotal tumor resection, no metastasis, and negative postoperative lumbar puncture CSF cytology. Two courses of eight drugs in 1 day followed by two courses of etoposide plus carboplatin (500 and 800 mg/m2 per course, respectively) were administered after surgery. Radiation therapy had to begin 90 days after surgery. Delivered doses were 55 Gy to the posterior fossa and 25 Gy to the brain and spinal canal.Results Between November 1991 and June 1998, 136 patients (median age, 8 years; median follow-up, 6.5 years) were included. The overall survival rate and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate were 73.8% ± 7.6% and 64.8% ± 8.1%, respectively. Radiologic review showed that 4% of patients were wrongly included. Review of radiotherapy technical files demonstrated a correlation between the presence of a major protocol deviation and treatment failure. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients included in this study with all optimal quality controls of histology, radiology, and radiotherapy was 71.8% ± 10.5%. In terms of sequelae, 31% of patients required growth hormone replacement therapy and 25% required special schooling.Conclusion Reduced-dose craniospinal radiation therapy can be proposed in standard-risk medulloblastoma provided staging and radiation therapy are performed under optimal conditions.},

abstract ={Purpose To compare event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), pattern of relapse, and hearing loss in children with standard-risk medulloblastoma treated by postoperative hyperfractionated or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy.Patients and Methods In all, 340 children age 4 to 21 years from 122 European centers were postoperatively staged and randomly assigned to treatment with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) or standard (conventional) fractionated radiotherapy (STRT) followed by a common chemotherapy regimen consisting of eight cycles of cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine.Results After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 0.1 to 8.3 years), survival rates were not significantly different between the two treatment arms: 5-year EFS was 77% ± 4% in the STRT group and 78% ± 4% in the HFRT group; corresponding 5-year OS was 87% ± 3% and 85% ± 3%, respectively. A postoperative residual tumor of more than 1.5 cm2 was the strongest negative prognostic factor. EFS of children with all reference assessments and no large residual tumor was 82% ± 2% at 5 years. Patients with a delay of more than 7 weeks to the start of RT had a worse prognosis. Severe hearing loss was not significantly different for the two treatment arms at follow-up.Conclusion In this large randomized European study, which enrolled patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma from more than 100 centers, excellent survival rates were achieved in patients without a large postoperative residual tumor and without RT treatment delays. EFS and OS for HFRT was not superior to STRT, which therefore remains standard of care in this disease.},
