    abstract = { Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of single-agent vinblastine in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade glioma. Patients and Methods Patients were eligible if they had experienced previous treatment failure (chemotherapy and/or radiation) for incompletely resected or unresectable low-grade glioma (LGG). Vinblastine (6 mg/m2) was administered weekly for 1 year unless unacceptable toxicity or progression (confirmed on two consecutive imaging studies) occurred. Results Fifty-one patients (age range, 1.4 to 18.2 years; median age, 7.2 years) were prospectively enrolled onto this phase II study. Fifty patients had previously received at least one prior regimen of chemotherapy, and 10 patients had previously received radiation treatment. Fifty patients were evaluable for response; 18 patients (36\%) had a complete, partial, or minor response, and 31 patients completed 1 year of treatment. At a median follow-up of 67 months, 23 patients had not experienced progression; three patients have died. Five-year overall survival was 93.2\% ± 3.8\%, and 5-year progression-free survival was 42.3\% ± 7.2\%. Toxicity was manageable and mostly hematologic, although a few patients needed transfusions. Conclusion Weekly vinblastine seems to be a reasonable alternative to radiation for pediatric patients with LGG who have experienced treatment failure with first-line chemotherapy. The 5-year progression-free survival observed in this phase II trial is comparable to results observed with first-line chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naive patients. The role of single-agent vinblastine and other vinca alkaloid in the management of pediatric LGGs deserves further investigation. }

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND Carboplatin-based regimens have demonstrated activity in unresectable low-grade glioma (LGG) in children. Despite an interesting toxicity profile, the use of these regimens has been limited by the development of carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) in up to 30\% of patients. Desensitization has been the recommended approach for HSR. However, no guidelines have existed to aid physicians when carboplatin desensitization techniques fail. METHODS A pilot study of monotherapy with weekly vinblastine for LGG in 9 children who developed carboplatin HSR on a carboplatin and vincristine regimen was performed. RESULTS Vinblastine toxicity was moderate and readily manageable. None of the 9 patients had disease progression on therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of tumor size from diagnosis to the end of vinblastine treatment showed 1 complete response (CR), 1 partial response (PR), 5 objective effects (OE), and 2 stable diseases (SD). CONCLUSIONS This experience suggested that weekly vinblastine has a good efficacy to toxicity ratio in the treatment of LGG and can be a valuable option for children who develop severe HSR.

The aim of this study was to assess the activity of vinblastine in therapy-naïve children.Patients and MethodsPatients < 18 years old with unresectable and/or progressive therapy-naïve PLGG were eligible. Vinblastine was administered once per week at a dose of 6 mg/m2 intravenously over a period of 70 weeks. Vision, quality of life, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) status, and BRAF mutation/fusion status were also determined and correlated with outcome.ResultsFifty-four patients were enrolled onto the study, with a median age of 8 years (range, 0.7 to 17.2 years). Most patients had chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors (55.5\%), and 13 patients (24.1\%) had NF1. The most common histology was pilocytic astrocytoma (46.3\%). Seventeen patients were diagnosed using radiologic criteria alone. Best response to chemotherapy was centrally reviewed with a response rate (complete, partial, or minor response) of 25.9\%. Disease stabilization (complete, partial, or minor response or stable disease) was achieved in 47 patients (87.0\%). Visual improvement was observed in 20\% of patients with optic pathway glioma. Five-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 94.4\% (95\% CI, 88.5\% to 100\%) and 53.2\% (95\% CI, 41.3\% to 68.5\%), respectively, for the entire cohort. Patients with NF1 had a significantly better PFS (85.1\%; 95\% CI, 68.0\% to 100\%) when compared with patients without NF1 (42.0\%; 95\% CI, 29.1\% to 60.7\%; P = .012). Age< 3 years or > 10 years was not associated with poor outcome. Treatment was well tolerated, and quality of life was not affected during treatment. In this trial, there was no correlation between BRAF alterations and outcome.ConclusionVinblastine administered once per week is well tolerated in children with treatment naïve PLGG. Overall survival and PFS are comparable to current therapies, with a favorable toxicity profile and a maintained quality of life. }

This study reports that MYB, an oncogene not previously implicated in gliomagenesis, is activated in a diverse subset of pediatric LGGs. The study cohort comprised 57 pediatric LGGs and a comparative cohort of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). The LGG cohort included 34 PAs and 23 diffuse gliomas; fibrillary astrocytomas (n = 14), oligodendroglial tumors (n = 7), and angiocentric gliomas (n = 2). MYB copy number abnormalities were disclosed using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays and confirmed using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Novel MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas. In addition, focal deletion of the terminal region of MYB was seen in 1 of 2 angiocentric gliomas (AGs). Increased expression of MYB was demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. MYB upregulation at the protein level was demonstrated in a proportion of diffuse LGGs (60{\%}), pilocytic astrocytomas (41{\%}), and HGGs (19{\%}), but abnormalities at the genomic level were only a feature of diffuse gliomas. Our data suggest that MYB may have a role in a subset of pediatric gliomas, through a variety of mechanisms in addition to MYB amplification and deletion.",

abstract="Low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) are diverse CNS tumors presenting in children and young adults, often with a history of epilepsy. While the genetic profiles of common LGNTs, such as the pilocytic astrocytoma and `adult-type' diffuse gliomas, are largely established, those of uncommon LGNTs remain to be defined. In this study, we have used massively parallel sequencing and various targeted molecular genetic approaches to study alterations in 91 LGNTs, mostly from children but including young adult patients. These tumors comprise dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs; n = 22), diffuse oligodendroglial tumors (d-OTs; n = 20), diffuse astrocytomas (DAs; n = 17), angiocentric gliomas (n = 15), and gangliogliomas (n = 17). Most LGNTs (84 {\%}) analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were characterized by a single driver genetic alteration. Alterations of FGFR1 occurred frequently in LGNTs composed of oligodendrocyte-like cells, being present in 82 {\%} of DNETs and 40 {\%} of d-OTs. In contrast, a MYB-QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (87 {\%}), and MYB fusion genes were the most common genetic alteration in DAs (41 {\%}). A BRAF:p.V600E mutation was present in 35 {\%} of gangliogliomas and 18 {\%} of DAs. Pathogenic alterations in FGFR1/2/3, BRAF, or MYB/MYBL1 occurred in 78 {\%} of the series. Adult-type d-OTs with an IDH1/2 mutation occurred in four adolescents, the youngest aged 15 years at biopsy. Despite a detailed analysis, novel genetic alterations were limited to two fusion genes, EWSR1-PATZ1 and SLMAP-NTRK2, both in gangliogliomas. Alterations in BRAF, FGFR1, or MYB account for most pathogenic alterations in LGNTs, including pilocytic astrocytomas, and alignment of these genetic alterations and cytologic features across LGNTs has diagnostic implications. Additionally, therapeutic options based upon targeting the effects of these alterations are already in clinical trials.",

abstract="Missense mutations of the V600E type constitute the vast majority of tumor-associated somatic alterations in the v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) gene. Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF                        V600E mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66{\%}) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65{\%}), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18{\%}), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9{\%}). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF                        V600E mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33{\%}). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF                        V600E mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities. Future clinical trials should address whether BRAF                        V600E mutant brain tumor patients will benefit from BRAF                        V600E-directed targeted therapies.",

A body of research over recent years has demonstrated a key role for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling in the development and behavior of PAs. Several mechanisms lead to activation of this pathway in PA, mostly in a mutually exclusive manner, with constitutive BRAF kinase activation subsequent to gene fusion being the most frequent. The high specificity of this fusion to PA when compared with other CNS tumors has diagnostic utility. In addition, the frequency of alteration of this key pathway provides an opportunity for molecularly targeted therapy in this tumor. Here, we review the current knowledge on mechanisms of MAPK activation in PA and some of the downstream consequences of this activation, which are now starting to be elucidated both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical considerations and possible future directions.",

	abstract = {Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) are the most common central nervous system tumor in 5 to 19 year olds. Little is known about the genetic alterations underlying their development. Here, we describe a tandem duplication of \~{}2 Mb at 7q34 occurring in 66\% of PAs. This rearrangement, which was not observed in a series of 244 higher-grade astrocytomas, results in an in-frame fusion gene incorporating the kinase domain of the BRAF oncogene. We further show that the resulting fusion protein has constitutive BRAF kinase activity and is able to transform NIH3T3 cells.

Variable locations, extent of resection, postoperative neurodiagnostic evaluation, and histology have confounded therapy and outcome. OBJECTIVES: To investigate disease control and survival after surgery. METHODS: A prospective natural history trial from 1991 to 1996 produced a subset of patients with low-grade gliomas managed by primary surgery and subsequent observation. Patients were evaluable if eligibility, tumor location, and extent of resection were confirmed by pathological diagnosis, preoperative and postoperative imaging, and the surgeon's report. Primary end points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and postprogression survival. RESULTS: Of 726 patients enrolled, 518 were fully evaluable for analysis. The 5- and 8-year OS rates were 97% $\pm$ 0.8% and 96% $\pm$ 0.9%, respectively, and PFS rates were 80% $\pm$ 1.8% and 78% $\pm$ 2.0%. In univariate analyses, histological type, extent of residual tumor, and disease site were significantly associated with PFS and OS. In multivariate analysis, gross total resection (GTR) without residual disease was the predominant predictor of PFS. In patients with limited residual disease, 56% were free of progression at 5 years. CONCLUSION: GTR should be the goal when it can be achieved with an acceptable functional outcome. The variable rate of progression after incomplete resection highlights the need for new predictors of tumor behavior.},

abstract ={Purpose The use of radiotherapy in pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) is controversial, especially for young patients. We conducted a phase II trial of conformal radiation therapy (CRT) to estimate disease control by using a 10-mm clinical target volume (CTV) margin.Materials and Methods Between August 1997 and August 2006, 78 pediatric patients with LGG and a median age of 8.9 years (range, 2.2 to 19.8 years) received 54 Gy CRT by using a 10-mm CTV and by targeting with systematic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) registration. Tumor locations were diencephalon (n = 58), cerebral hemisphere (n = 3), and cerebellum (n = 17). Sixty-seven patients had documented or presumed WHO grade 1 tumors, 25 patients had prior chemotherapy, and 13 patients had neurofibromatosis type 1.Results During a median follow-up of 89 months, 13 patients experienced disease progression. One patient experienced marginal treatment failure, eight experienced local failures, and four experienced metastatic failure. The mean and standard error 5- and 10-year event-free (87.4% ± 4.4% and 74.3% ± 15.4%, respectively) and overall (98.5% ± 1.6% and 95.9% ± 5.8%, respectively) survival rates were determined. The mean and standard error cumulative incidences of local failure at 5 and 10 years were 8.7% ± 3.5% and 16.4% ± 5.4%, respectively. The mean and standard error cumulative incidence of vasculopathy was 4.79% ± 2.73% at 6 years, and it was higher for those younger than 5 years of age (P = .0105) at the time of CRT.Conclusion This large, prospective series of irradiated children with LGG demonstrates that CRT with a 10-mm CTV does not compromise disease control. The results suggest that CRT should be delayed in young patients to reduce the risk of vasculopathy.},

abstract ={Purpose We conducted a prospective trial to evaluate late effects in pediatric patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) treated with conformal radiation therapy (CRT).Patients and Methods Between August 1997 and August 2006, 78 pediatric patients with LGG (mean age, 9.7 years; standard deviation, ±4.4 years) received 54 Gy of CRT with a 10-mm clinical target volume margin. Tumor locations were diencephalon (n = 58), cerebral hemisphere (n = 3), and cerebellum (n = 17). Baseline and serial evaluations were performed to identify deficits in cognition, endocrine function, and hearing. Deficits were correlated with clinical factors and radiation dose within specific normal tissue volumes.Results Cognitive effects of CRT through 5 years after CRT correlated with patient age, neurofibromatosis type 1 status, tumor location and volume, extent of resection, and radiation dose. The effect of age exceeded that of radiation dose; patients younger than 5 years experienced the greatest decline in cognition. Before CRT, growth hormone (GH) secretion abnormality was diagnosed in 24% of tested patients, and 12% had precocious puberty. The 10-year cumulative incidence of GH replacement was 48.9%; of thyroid hormone replacement, 64.0%; of glucocorticoid replacement, 19.2%; and of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy, 34.2%. The mean ± standard errors of the cumulative incidence of hearing loss at 10 years did not exceed 5.7% ± 3.3% at any frequency.Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest series of prospectively followed children with LGG to undergo irradiation. Adverse effects are limited and predictable for most patients; however, this study provides additional evidence that CRT should be delayed for young patients and identifies the potential benefits of reducing radiation dose to normal brain.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low grade gliomas arise in all CNS-locations and age groups, chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors occur especially in young children. Early radiotherapy (RT) shall be deferred by chemotherapy (CT) within the concept of the HIT-LGG 1996 study, offering a comprehensive treatment strategy for all age groups. PATIENTS: 198 of 905 protocol patients (21.9 %) had a chiasmatic (34), chiasmatic-hypothalamic (144) or hypothalamic (20) primary tumor, median age at diagnosis 3.6 years (0.2-16.3 y.), 54 had neurofibromatosis (27.3 %), 108 female (54.5 %). 98 children had severe visual impairment as their first symptom. The initial neurosurgical intervention resulted in 5 complete, 26 subtotal, 45 partial resections, 67 biopsies; 55 children had a diagnosis on the basis of neuroradiologic findings. Histology showed 132 pilocytic astrocytoma I degrees , 6 astrocytoma II degrees /nos and 2 DIGG/DIA I degrees (3 not known). RESULTS: 82 children were treated at diagnosis, 68 upon clinical or radiological progression following observation times of 3.0 to 115.0 months. RT: 27 children received conventional (18) or interstitial (8) RT (1 not documented) at a median age of 7.3 years; 7 tumors went into further progression. At a median observation time of 50.1 months 21 tumors are stable, 3 regressive (2 not evaluable, 1 death). CT: 123 children received vincristin/carboplatin at a median age of 3.7 years. 105/123 achieved CR/PR/SD. 44/123 tumors were progressive after median 22.5 months, 37 with a chiasmatic-hypothalamic primary, 16/44 were irradiated. At a median observation time of 44.7 months 2 children are in complete remission, 92 tumors are stable, 8 regressive, 9 progressive. 4 children died, 8 are not evaluable. At 60 months overall survival of the cohort is 0.93; PFS of the CT-group is 0.61, the RT-free survival 0.83. Within the CT-group children with an age at diagnosis < 1 year and non-pilocytic histology are at increased risk for early progression. Causative factors cannot be defined, yet. CONCLUSION: Within the comprehensive treatment strategy for low grade glioma HIT-LGG 1996 chemotherapy is effective to delay the need for early radiotherapy in chiasmatic-hypothalamic glioma. More effective reduction of the risk for progression has to be sought for young children < 1 year.},

	Abstract = {Between March 9, 1984 and January 29, 1992, 42 children with newly diagnosed symptomatic or previously diagnosed progressive low-grade gliomas received outpatient chemotherapy as their primary treatment. This study was a single arm, phase II trial designed to estimate the time to tumor progression and toxicity of this regimen. Procarbazine, 6-thioguanine, and dibromodulcitol were given before lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine was given 1 and 3 weeks after CCNU. Patients were treated for six treatment cycles or until the tumor progressed, whichever came first. Twenty-three patients had juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, 11 had astrocytomas, one had oligodendroglioma, one had ganglioglioma, and six had radiographically diagnosed low-grade gliomas. The mean age of the patients was 5 years (median, 3 years). The median time to treatment failure was 132 weeks (95% confidence interval: 106, 186 weeks). Only eight patients have died the estimated 5-year survival rate is 78% (95% confidence interval, 60% 87%). There were two episodes of grade 4 neutropenia, and three episodes of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. This regimen was safe, able to be delivered in the outpatient setting, and produced prolonged periods of disease stabilization in children with low-grade gliomas.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to avoid radiotherapy and to induce an objective response in children with low-grade glioma (LGG) using a simple chemotherapy regimen based on cisplatin and etoposide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four children (median age, 45 months) with unresectable LGG were treated with 10 monthly cycles of cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 3) and etoposide (150 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 to 3). Tumor originated in the visual pathway in 29 patients, in the temporal lobe in two, in the frontal lobe in two, and in the spine in one. Eight children were affected by neurofibromatosis type 1. Objective tumor response and toxicity were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic and functional tests at 3-month intervals. RESULTS: An objective response was obtained in 24 (70%) of 34 patients, whereas the others had stable disease. None of the children were electively irradiated. In 31 previously untreated children, overall survival was 100% and progression-free survival was 78% at 3 years, with a median follow-up of 44 months. Acute toxicity was unremarkable; 28% patients evaluated for acoustic neurotoxicity revealed a loss of perception of high frequencies. CONCLUSION: Cisplatin and etoposide combined treatment is one of the most active regimens for LGG in children and allows avoidance of radiotherapy in the vast majority of patients.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the activity of carboplatin and iproplatin in children with progressive or recurrent brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was designed to evaluate the activity of these agents and to compare the toxicities associated with their use. Treatment consisted of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 at 4-week intervals or iproplatin 270 mg/m2 at 3-week intervals. RESULTS: The major toxicity observed was myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia, for both agents. Ototoxicity (grade 1 or 2) was seen in 2.5% of patients treated with carboplatin and 1.3% of patients treated with iproplatin. The majority of patients with low-grade astrocytic neoplasms treated with carboplatin (nine of 12 patients) or iproplatin (eight of 12 patients) demonstrated tumor response or prolonged stable disease that persisted off-therapy. The duration of stable disease produced by carboplatin was particularly striking, ranging from 2 months to 68 + months (median, 40 + months). Neither drug demonstrated appreciable activity in the treatment of medulloblastoma (two of 26 responses to carboplatin, one of 14 responses to iproplatin), ependymoma (two of 17 responses to carboplatin, none of seven responses to iproplatin), high-grade glioma (two of 19 responses to carboplatin, one of 14 responses to iproplatin), or brain-stem tumors (one of 23 responses to carboplatin, none of 14 responses to iproplatin). CONCLUSION: Carboplatin is active against low-grade gliomas. Further evaluation of the role of carboplatin in the preirradiation treatment of children with low-grade gliomas of the optic pathway is currently underway in a clinical trial.},

abstract ={Low-grade glioma (LGG) in children and adolescents have a spectrum of presentations determining various therapies. The SIOP-LGG 2004 strategy recommends observation following complete resection or after incomplete surgery without severe or threatening symptoms, and age-stratified radio- and chemotherapy for patients with severe symptoms or later progression. The intensity of induction chemotherapy (2 vs. 3 drugs) is the randomised study question for sporadic LGG (NF1-ve). Multicentre radiology and pathology reviews are integrated. Of 3206 patients registered from 01.04.2004 to 30.01.2012 in 12 countries, 1786 were observed, 1133 treated (35.5%), 66 in evaluation (221 incomplete data), 1540/2985 are males, 100/2985 disseminated, 453/2985 NF1 + ve. Main tumour localisation: supratentorial midline (40%), main histology: pilocytic astrocytoma (46%). 32% of tumours are diagnosed radiologically. Patients under observation have more frequently initial complete resection (33%), in cerebral/cerebellar locations (60%), with pilocytic histology (51%), but with diffuse glioma (3.8%) and glioneuronal tumours (6.9%), as well. They had radiologic diagnosis in 14%. Visual impairment, focal neurologic deficits and tumour progression constitute the main indication for (age-stratified) non-surgical treatment. Patients in the chemotherapy group (n = 930) had a median age of 3.8 years, 26% were NF1 + ve, and treatment started within 3 months in 60%. Radiotherapy was used in 181 patients (median age 10.1 years), 4% were NF1 + ve, 38% started treatment <3 months. Distribution of tumour sites, extent of resection and histologies was comparable in the treatment-groups. 486 sporadic/NF1-ve patients were randomised, 15% aged <1 year, 39% with visual pathway tumours, 14% disseminated. Induction treatment was completed comparably in both arms. 5-year overall-survival is 99.3% for children being observed and 85.8% for those selected for non-surgical treatment. This European trial for childhood LGG providing therapy-guidelines as well as randomisation for a subgroup has high patient recruitment and adherence to the multi-disciplinary strategy including age stratification. Data quality control measures are in progress.},

abstract ={Purpose Surgery is curative therapy for pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) in areas of the brain amenable to complete resection. However, LGGs located in areas where complete resection is not possible can threaten both function and life. The purpose of this study was to compare two chemotherapy regimens for LGGs in children younger than age 10 years for whom radiotherapy was felt by the practitioner to pose a high risk of neurodevelopmental injury.Patients and Methods Previously untreated children younger than age 10 years with progressive or residual LGGs were eligible. Children were randomly assigned to receive carboplatin and vincristine (CV) or thioguanine, procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (TPCV). Children with neurofibromatosis are reported separately.Results Of 274 randomly assigned patients who met eligibility requirements, 137 received CV and 137 received TPCV. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all eligible patients were 45% ± 3.2% and 86% ± 2.2%, respectively. The 5-year EFS rates were 39% ± 4% for CV and 52% ± 5% for TPCV (stratified log-rank test P = .10; cure model analysis P = .007). On multivariate analysis, factors independently predictive of worse EFS and OS were younger age and tumor size greater than 3 cm2. Tumor location in the thalamus was also associated with poor OS.Conclusion The difference in EFS between the regimens did not reach significance on the basis of the stratified log-rank test. The 5-year EFS was higher for TPCV on the basis of the cure model analysis. Differences in toxicity may influence physician choice of regimens.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology of primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) in pediatric patients from a Brazilian oncology institute. We retrospectively analyzed 741 charts (415 males and 326 females) of patients under 21 years of age who were diagnosed with a CNS tumor. The analysis included patients from 1989 to 2009 and was performed using the World Health Organization criteria. We evaluated the distribution of age, sex, topography, clinical symptoms, symptom intervals, and classification of the tumors. Patients with clinical/radiologic diagnoses were included. Seven hundred forty-one patients with tumors in the CNS were reviewed, and 83% of the patients presented a histologic diagnosis. Males (56%) were more prevalent than females. In children under the age of 1 year, the supratentorial compartment was the predominant region involved (62.0%). Astrocytoma was the most frequent tumor type (37.0%), followed by medulloblastoma (13.6%), craniopharyngioma (10.5%), and ependymoma (6.8%). Headaches were the most common symptom, and the symptom intervals varied from 1 to 5010 days. Approximately 4% of the patients had associated genetic syndromes. Although it was not a population study and selection bias may have occurred, this study supplies important epidemiologic data from an emerging country in which population studies are rare.},

	Abstract = {OBJECT: The purpose of this study is to determine the epidemiology of tumors of the nervous system diagnosed according to the WHO 2000 classification in a single Brazilian institution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: One thousand one hundred ninety-five tumors in children between 0 and 21 years of age diagnosed between 1974 and 2003 were classified according the sex, topography, and age distribution. RESULTS: In all ages, males were slightly more affected. In the first 2 years, the prevalence for boys was higher (68.3%). In the whole series, 58.7% were supratentorial, 31.4% infratentorial, and 9.9% spinal (44% intra- and 56% extramedullary). Among these latter, ependymomas and schwannomas were the most frequent. In the cerebral compartment, pilocytic astrocytomas were the single most frequent tumors (18%), followed by diffuse astrocytomas (14%), medulloblastomas (11%), and craniopharyngiomas (11%). In the posterior fossa, there was an even distribution among medulloblastomas and pilocytic astrocytomas, but the former was much more frequent in the first 2 years of age. High-grade (III and IV) diffuse astrocytomas were slightly more frequent than low grades (II), and this difference becomes more evident as the child grows older. Due to the new development of the surgery of epilepsy, the frequency of neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors is increasing (8%). CONCLUSION: Classified according to the latest WHO classification, by a single neuropathologist in a single institution, this large series of pediatric neurological tumors may reflect fairly well their real incidence. Our results obtained in a developing country do not differ substantially from other similar series reported in the literature from the First World.},

abstract ={Objective The primary objective of this study was to decrease the late effects of prophylactic radiation without reducing survival in standard-risk childhood medulloblastoma.Patients and Methods Inclusion criteria were as follows: children between the ages of 3 and 18 years with total or subtotal tumor resection, no metastasis, and negative postoperative lumbar puncture CSF cytology. Two courses of eight drugs in 1 day followed by two courses of etoposide plus carboplatin (500 and 800 mg/m2 per course, respectively) were administered after surgery. Radiation therapy had to begin 90 days after surgery. Delivered doses were 55 Gy to the posterior fossa and 25 Gy to the brain and spinal canal.Results Between November 1991 and June 1998, 136 patients (median age, 8 years; median follow-up, 6.5 years) were included. The overall survival rate and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate were 73.8% ± 7.6% and 64.8% ± 8.1%, respectively. Radiologic review showed that 4% of patients were wrongly included. Review of radiotherapy technical files demonstrated a correlation between the presence of a major protocol deviation and treatment failure. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients included in this study with all optimal quality controls of histology, radiology, and radiotherapy was 71.8% ± 10.5%. In terms of sequelae, 31% of patients required growth hormone replacement therapy and 25% required special schooling.Conclusion Reduced-dose craniospinal radiation therapy can be proposed in standard-risk medulloblastoma provided staging and radiation therapy are performed under optimal conditions.},

abstract ={Purpose To compare event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), pattern of relapse, and hearing loss in children with standard-risk medulloblastoma treated by postoperative hyperfractionated or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy.Patients and Methods In all, 340 children age 4 to 21 years from 122 European centers were postoperatively staged and randomly assigned to treatment with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) or standard (conventional) fractionated radiotherapy (STRT) followed by a common chemotherapy regimen consisting of eight cycles of cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine.Results After a median follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 0.1 to 8.3 years), survival rates were not significantly different between the two treatment arms: 5-year EFS was 77% ± 4% in the STRT group and 78% ± 4% in the HFRT group; corresponding 5-year OS was 87% ± 3% and 85% ± 3%, respectively. A postoperative residual tumor of more than 1.5 cm2 was the strongest negative prognostic factor. EFS of children with all reference assessments and no large residual tumor was 82% ± 2% at 5 years. Patients with a delay of more than 7 weeks to the start of RT had a worse prognosis. Severe hearing loss was not significantly different for the two treatment arms at follow-up.Conclusion In this large randomized European study, which enrolled patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma from more than 100 centers, excellent survival rates were achieved in patients without a large postoperative residual tumor and without RT treatment delays. EFS and OS for HFRT was not superior to STRT, which therefore remains standard of care in this disease.},

abstract="The 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System is both a conceptual and practical advance over its 2007 predecessor. For the first time, the WHO classification of CNS tumors uses molecular parameters in addition to histology to define many tumor entities, thus formulating a concept for how CNS tumor diagnoses should be structured in the molecular era. As such, the 2016 CNS WHO presents major restructuring of the diffuse gliomas, medulloblastomas and other embryonal tumors, and incorporates new entities that are defined by both histology and molecular features, including glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype and glioblastoma, IDH-mutant; diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M--mutant; RELA fusion--positive ependymoma; medulloblastoma, WNT-activated and medulloblastoma, SHH-activated; and embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes, C19MC-altered. The 2016 edition has added newly recognized neoplasms, and has deleted some entities, variants and patterns that no longer have diagnostic and/or biological relevance. Other notable changes include the addition of brain invasion as a criterion for atypical meningioma and the introduction of a soft tissue-type grading system for the now combined entity of solitary fibrous tumor / hemangiopericytoma---a departure from the manner by which other CNS tumors are graded. Overall, it is hoped that the 2016 CNS WHO will facilitate clinical, experimental and epidemiological studies that will lead to improvements in the lives of patients with brain tumors.",

abstract={We conducted a phase II study to test methotrexate (5 g/m2), as a single agent prior to radiochemotherapy for pediatric high-grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Thirty patients (19 male, median age 10.8) were enrolled. Tumors were located as follows: cortex 10, pons 7, other 13. Tumor resection was classified as gross total in 6, subtotal in 6, partial in 4, biopsy in 11 and not performed in 3. WHO grading of the histology was: IV: 11, III: 12 and II: 3. Patients received methotrexate 5 g/m2 in 24-hour infusions on days 1 and 15. Subsequently 54 Gy radiation was administered with simultaneous chemotherapy including cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine and ifosfamide as previously described. Eight 6-weeks cycles of maintenance chemotherapy consisted of vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15; lomustine 100 mg/m2 on day 2 and prednisone 40 mg/kg on days 1--17. Event-free survival rates in the whole group of 30 patients were: 43, 20, and 13{\%} after 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively. The response evaluation after methotrexate was available in 19 of the 24 patients who started treatment with measurable disease: CR: 0, PR: 1, SD 18, PD: 0. After radiochemotherapy the response of 24 patients with measurable disease was CR: 1, PR 10, SD 12, PD 1. Both response and event-free survival were superior to the control group of 330 patients treated in various protocols of the same cooperative group. In subgroup analyses the use of dexamethasone during early treatment was linked to poor event free survival. Giving two cycles of high-dose methotrexate prior to radiochemotherapy was feasible, and the approach was taken forward to a randomized phase III trial.},

abstract = { Purpose To determine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of children with average-risk medulloblastoma and treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiotherapy (CSRT) and one of two postradiotherapy chemotherapies. Methods Four hundred twenty-one patients between 3 years and 21 years of age with nondisseminated medulloblastoma (MB) were prospectively randomly assigned to treatment with 23.4 Gy of CSRT, 55.8 Gy of posterior fossa RT, plus one of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens: lomustine (CCNU), cisplatin, and vincristine; or cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and vincristine. Results Forty-two of 421 patients enrolled were excluded from analysis. Sixty-six of the remaining 379 patients had incompletely assessable postoperative studies. Five-year EFS and survival for the cohort of 379 patients was 81\% ± 2.1\% and 86\% ± 9\%, respectively (median follow-up over 5 years). EFS was unaffected by sex, race, age, treatment regimen, brainstem involvement, or excessive anaplasia. EFS was detrimentally affected by neuroradiographic unassessability. Patients with areas of frank dissemination had a 5-year EFS of 36\% ± 15\%. Sixty-seven percent of progressions had some component of dissemination. There were seven second malignancies. Infections occurred more frequently on the cyclophosphamide arm and electrolyte abnormalities were more common on the CCNU regimen. Conclusion This study discloses an encouraging EFS rate for children with nondisseminated MB treated with reduced-dose craniospinal radiation and chemotherapy. Additional, careful, step-wise reductions in CSRT in adequately staged patients may be possible. }

abstract = { Purpose To evaluate response rate, event-free survival (EFS), and toxicity of two chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of children younger than 36 months with malignant brain tumors and to estimate control intervals without irradiation in children with no residual tumor after initial surgery and induction chemotherapy and with delayed irradiation in patients with residual tumor or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to one of two regimens of induction chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide v vincristine, carboplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide). Maintenance chemotherapy began after induction in children without progressive disease. Children with no residual tumors after induction therapy and no metastatic disease at diagnosis were not to receive radiation therapy unless their tumors progressed. Results Two hundred ninety-nine infants were enrolled. Forty-two percent of patients responded to induction chemotherapy. At 5 years from study entry, the EFS rate was 27\% ± 3\%, and the survival rate was 43\% ± 3\%. There was no significant difference between the two arms in terms of response rate or EFS. For medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, ependymoma, and rhabdoid tumors, 5-year EFS rates were 32\% ± 5\%, 17\% ± 6\%, and 32\% ± 6\%, and 14\% ± 7\%, respectively. Fifty-eight percent of patients who were alive 5 years after study entry had not received radiation therapy. Conclusion Intensified induction chemotherapy resulted in a high response rate of malignant brain tumors in infants. Survival was comparable to that of previous studies, and most patients who survived did not receive radiation therapy. }

abstract = { Purpose We evaluated the feasibility of administering carboplatin as a radiosensitizer during craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) to patients with high-risk medulloblastomas (MBs) and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and we report the outcome in the subset with metastatic (M+) MB. Patients and Methods After surgery, patients received 36 Gy CSRT with boosts to sites of disease. During radiation, patients received 15 to 30 doses of carboplatin (30-45 mg/m2/dose), along with vincristine (VCR) once per week for 6 weeks. Patients on regimen A received 6 months of maintenance chemotherapy (MC) with cyclophosphamide and VCR. Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of carboplatin was determined, cisplatin was added to the MC (regimen B). Results In all, 161 eligible patients (median age, 8.7 years; range, 3.1 to 21.6 years) were enrolled. Myelosuppression was dose limiting and 35 mg/m2/dose × 30 was determined to be the RP2D of carboplatin. Twenty-nine (36\%) of 81 patients with M+ MB had diffuse anaplasia. Four patients were taken off study within 11 months of completing radiotherapy for presumed metastatic progression and are long-term survivors following palliative chemotherapy. Excluding these four patients, 5-year overall survival ± SE and progression-free survival ± SE for M+ patients treated at the RP2D on regimen A was 82\% ± 9\% and 71\% ± 11\% versus 68\% ± 10\% and 59\% ± 10\% on regimen B (P = .36). There was no difference in survival by M stage. Anaplasia was a negative predictor of outcome. Conclusion The use of carboplatin as a radiosensitizer is a promising strategy for patients with M+ MB. Early progression should be confirmed by biopsy. }

abstract = {Summary What is known and objective The off‐label use of medicines is widespread in several diseases. This type of prescribing practice is particularly more acute in oncology. However, the suitability of anticancer medications for off‐label use remains an issue of controversy, due to uncertainty around the clinical benefits and potential toxicities, limited evidence to support clinical decision‐making, increased out‐of‐pocket costs for patients and ethical concerns around the lack of informed consent. Currently, data pertaining to the global prevalence of off‐label use in cancer therapy are lacking. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of off‐label drug use prevalence in oncology. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines from 1975 to 2016. Studies assessing the prevalence of off‐label use of anticancer drugs were included. Data synthesis Of the 199 eligible papers retrieved, 23 studies were included in this systematic literature review. Off‐label drug use in inpatients ranged from 18\% to 41\%. Among adult patients with cancer, 13\%–71\% received a minimum of one off‐label chemotherapy. The main reasons for off‐label drug use were ‘drug unapproved for specific tumour’ and ‘modified drug applications’. Among adults, metastatic cancers and palliative care patients received the most off‐label drugs. The off‐label drug use unsupported by standard treatment guidelines or drug compendia was in the range of 7\%–31\%. Conclusion Off‐label drug use in cancer therapy is commonly practised but outcomes could vary significantly. Hence, greater scrutiny and robust clinical guidance is needed to establish the favourable benefit–risk ratio for patients at the time of prescribing at each level of oncology care to facilitate rational off‐label prescribing.}

    abstract = "{Anticancer cytotoxic agents go through a process by which their antitumor activity—on the
basis
of the amount of tumor shrinkage they could generate—has been investigated. In the late
1970s,
the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization introduced specific
criteria
for the codification of tumor response evaluation. In 1994, several organizations involved in
clinical
research combined forces to tackle the review of these criteria on the basis of the experience and
knowledge acquired since then. After several years of intensive discussions, a new set of
guidelines is
ready that will supersede the former criteria. In parallel to this initiative, one of the participating
groups
developed a model by which response rates could be derived from unidimensional measurement of
tumor lesions instead of the usual bidimensional approach. This new concept has been largely
validated
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group and integrated into the present
guidelines.
This special article also provides some philosophic background to clarify the various purposes of
response evaluation. It proposes a model by which a combined assessment of all existing lesions,
characterized by target lesions (to be measured) and nontarget lesions, is used to extrapolate an
overall
response to treatment. Methods of assessing tumor lesions are better codified, briefly within the
guidelines and in more detail in Appendix I. All other aspects of response evaluation have been
discussed, reviewed, and amended whenever appropriate. }",

    abstract = { PURPOSEThe Children’s Oncology Group trial ACNS0121 estimated event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival for children with intracranial ependymoma treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and—selectively—with chemotherapy. Treatment was administered according to tumor location, histologic grade, and extent of resection. The impacts of histologic grade, focal copy number gain on chromosome 1q, and DNA methylation profiles were studied for those undergoing surgery and immediate postoperative conformal radiation therapy (CRT).METHODSACNS0121 included 356 newly diagnosed patients (ages 1 to 21 years). Patients with classic supratentorial ependymoma were observed after gross total resection (GTR). Those undergoing subtotal resection received chemotherapy, second surgery, and CRT. The remaining patients received immediate postoperative CRT after near-total resection or GTR. CRT was administered with a 1.0-cm clinical target volume margin. The cumulative total dose was 59.4 Gy, except for patients who underwent GTR and were younger than age 18 months (who received 54 Gy). Patients were enrolled between October 2003 and September 2007 and were observed for 5 years. Supratentorial tumors were evaluated for RELA fusion; infratentorial tumors, for chromosome 1q gain. Classification of posterior fossa groups A and B was made by methylation profiles.RESULTSThe 5-year EFS rates were 61.4\% (95\% CI, 34.5\% to 89.6\%), 37.2\% (95\% CI, 24.8\% to 49.6\%), and 68.5\% (95\% CI, 62.8\% to 74.2\%) for observation, subtotal resection, and near-total resection/GTR groups given immediate postoperative CRT, respectively. The 5-year EFS rates differed significantly by tumor grade (P = .0044) but not by age, location, RELA fusion status, or posterior fossa A/posterior fossa B grouping. EFS was higher for patients with infratentorial tumors without 1q gain than with 1q gain (82.8\% [95\% CI, 74.4\% to 91.2\%] v 47.4\% [95\% CI, 26.0\% to 68.8\%]; P = .0013).CONCLUSIONThe EFS for patients with ependymoma younger than 3 years of age who received immediate postoperative CRT and for older patients is similar. Irradiation should remain the mainstay of care for most subtypes. }

    abstract = { PurposePosterior fossa ependymoma comprises two distinct molecular variants termed EPN\_PFA and EPN\_PFB that have a distinct biology and natural history. The therapeutic value of cytoreductive surgery and radiation therapy for posterior fossa ependymoma after accounting for molecular subgroup is not known.MethodsFour independent nonoverlapping retrospective cohorts of posterior fossa ependymomas (n = 820) were profiled using genome-wide methylation arrays. Risk stratification models were designed based on known clinical and newly described molecular biomarkers identified by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses.ResultsMolecular subgroup is a powerful independent predictor of outcome even when accounting for age or treatment regimen. Incompletely resected EPN\_PFA ependymomas have a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year progression-free survival ranging from 26.1\% to 56.8\% across all four cohorts. Although first-line (adjuvant) radiation is clearly beneficial for completely resected EPN\_PFA, a substantial proportion of patients with EPN\_PFB can be cured with surgery alone, and patients with relapsed EPN\_PFB can often be treated successfully with delayed external-beam irradiation.ConclusionThe most impactful biomarker for posterior fossa ependymoma is molecular subgroup affiliation, independent of other demographic or treatment variables. However, both EPN\_PFA and EPN\_PFB still benefit from increased extent of resection, with the survival rates being particularly poor for subtotally resected EPN\_PFA, even with adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients with EPN\_PFB who undergo gross total resection are at lower risk for relapse and should be considered for inclusion in a randomized clinical trial of observation alone with radiation reserved for those who experience recurrence. }

Multiple resections were performed in 46/160 children (28.8\\%). A boost was given to 24/40 ED patients achieving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of 58.1\\% and 68.7\\%, respectively, in this poor prognosis subgroup. For the whole series, 5-year PFS and OS rates were 65.4\\% and 81.1\\%, with no toxic deaths. On multivariable analysis, NED status and grade II were favorable for OS, and for PFS grade II remained favorable.In a multicenter collaboration, this trial accrued the highest number of patients published so far, and results are comparable to the best single-institution series. The RT boost, when feasible, seemed effective in improving prognosis. Even after multiple procedures, complete resection confirmed its prognostic strength, along with tumor grade. Biological parameters emerging in this series will be the object of future correlatives and reports.}",

    abstract = { Ependymoma is a locally aggressive tumor with metastatic potential that arises in diverse locations throughout the brain and spine in children. Tumor and treatment may result in significant morbidity. Cure remains elusive for many patients owing to diverse biology and resistance to conventional therapy. The implementation of systematic postoperative irradiation in clinical trials during the past 20 years has increased the proportion of patients achieving durable disease control with excellent results, as measured by objective functional outcome measures. Clinical, pathologic, and molecular risk stratification should be used to refine treatment regimens for children with ependymoma to reduce the risk of complications associated with therapy and increase the rate of disease control in the setting of combined modality or more intensive therapy. This review covers standards of care and current clinical trials for children with ependymoma, emphasizing the history and evolution of treatment regimens during the past 20 years and the clinical questions they hoped to address. }

abstract="Multiple independent genomic profiling efforts have recently identified clinically and molecularly distinct subgroups of ependymoma arising from all three anatomic compartments of the central nervous system (supratentorial brain, posterior fossa, and spinal cord). These advances motivated a consensus meeting to discuss: (1) the utility of current histologic grading criteria, (2) the integration of molecular-based stratification schemes in future clinical trials for patients with ependymoma and (3) current therapy in the context of molecular subgroups. Discussion at the meeting generated a series of consensus statements and recommendations from the attendees, which comment on the prognostic evaluation and treatment decisions of patients with intracranial ependymoma (WHO Grade II/III) based on the knowledge of its molecular subgroups. The major consensus among attendees was reached that treatment decisions for ependymoma (outside of clinical trials) should not be based on grading (II vs III). Supratentorial and posterior fossa ependymomas are distinct diseases, although the impact on therapy is still evolving. Molecular subgrouping should be part of all clinical trials henceforth.",

    abstract = { PurposeChildren with histologically diagnosed high-risk medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the CNS (CNS-PNET), and pineoblastoma (PBL) have had poor survival despite intensive treatment. We included these patients in this Children’s Oncology Group trial. Molecular profiling later revealed tumor heterogeneity that was not detectable at protocol inception. Enrollment of patients with CNS-PNET/PBL was subsequently discontinued, and outcomes for this part of the study are reported here.Patients and MethodsIn this phase III, four-arm prospective trial, consenting children age 3-22 years with newly diagnosed CNS-PNET were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive carboplatin during radiation and/or adjuvant isotretinoin after standard intensive therapy. Primary outcome measure was event-free survival (EFS) in the intent-to-treat population. Molecular tumor classification was retrospectively completed using DNA methylation profiling.ResultsEighty-five participants with institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs/PBLs were enrolled. Of 60 patients with sufficient tissue, 31 were nonpineal in location, of which 22 (71\%) represented tumors that were not intended for trial inclusion, including 18 high-grade gliomas (HGGs), two atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, and two ependymomas. Outcomes across tumor types were strikingly different. Patients with supratentorial embryonal tumors/PBLs exhibited 5-year EFS and overall survival of 62.8\% (95\% CI, 43.4\% to 82.2\%) and 78.5\% (95\% CI, 62.2\% to 94.8\%), respectively, whereas patients with molecularly classified HGG had EFS and overall survival of 5.6\% (95\% CI, 0\% to 13.0\%) and 12.0\% (95\% CI, 0\% to 24.7\%), respectively. Neither carboplatin, nor isotretinoin significantly altered outcomes for all patients. Survival for patients with HGG was similar to that of historic studies that avoid craniospinal irradiation and intensive chemotherapy.ConclusionFor patients with CNS-PNET/PBL, prognosis is considerably better than previously assumed when molecularly confirmed HGGs are removed. Identification of molecular HGGs may spare affected children from unhelpful intensive treatment. This trial highlights the challenges of a histology-based diagnosis for pediatric brain tumors and indicates that molecular profiling should become a standard component of initial diagnosis. }

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND. Effective chemotherapy is lacking for most types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. Temozolomide, an agent with activity against adult brain tumors, was investigated in children and adolescents with recurrent CNS tumors. METHODS. Temozolomide was administered orally as monthly 5-day courses at doses of 200 mg/m2/d (patients with no prior craniospinal irradiation [CSI]) or 180 mg/m2/d (prior CSI). Patients with a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response or stable disease (SD) could continue temozolomide for up to 12 cycles. RESULTS. The cohort comprised 122 patients, including 113 with CNS tumors. Median age was 11 years (range, 1–23 years). Among 104 evaluable patients with CNS tumors, 5 PRs and 1 CR were observed. PRs occurred in 1 of 23 evaluable patients with high-grade astrocytoma, 1 of 21 with low-grade astrocytoma, and 3 of 25 with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). The CR occurred in an additional patient with medulloblastoma/PNET. No responses were observed in patients with ependymoma, brain-stem glioma, or other CNS tumors. Notably, 41\% of patients with low-grade astrocytoma had SD through 12 courses. The most frequent toxicities were grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (19\%) and thrombocytopenia (25\%); nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent. CONCLUSIONS. Although overall objective responses were limited, further exploration of temozolomide may be warranted in children with medulloblastoma and other PNETs, or in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, perhaps in a setting of less pretreatment than the patients in the current study, or in the context of multiagent therapy.

abstract = {Abstract Background. The prognosis for children with recurrent or resistant malignant solid tumors remains dismal. More effective rescue therapy is needed for these children. Methods. Between August 1987 and November 1990, 311 children with recurrent or resistant malignant solid tumors were treated by investigators in the Pediatric Oncology Group with intravenous infusions of 2.0 g/m2 of ifosfamide and 100 mg/m2 of etoposide (VP-16) plus mesna as uroprotection three times daily, with courses being repeated every 14–21 days for as long as the patients responded to therapy. Results. Seventy-four percent of the 294 assessable patients entered in the study had metastatic disease and previously had been treated heavily. The complete response/partial response rate was 30\%, and the overall response rate was 39.5\%. Toxic effects included nephrotoxicity, mild liver dysfunction, neurotoxicity, and myelosuppression. Sixty-eight percent had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500/μl. In 1606 courses of therapy administered, only 3.6\% of patients developed a bacterial infection. Only two patients died of gram-negative sepsis. Four percent of the patients had gross hematuria (> 50 erythrocytes/high-power field), and 18.5\% had microscopic hematuria (< 20 erythrocytes/high-power field). Fanconi syndrome developed in eight children. Conclusions. Ifosfamide/VP-16 is an active combination in children with recurrent malignant solid tumors. Although it was myelosuppressive, the incidence of infection was quite low (3.6\%). Mesna was very effective in preventing the development of hematuria.}, year = {1993}

We determined the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) of children with recurrent/refractory sarcomas who were given ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) in three Children's Cancer Group (CCG) phase I/II trials. Procedure Children with recurrent/refractory sarcoma were treated with ifosfamide (1,800 mg/m2/day on day 0–4), carboplatin (400 mg/m2/day on day 0–1), etoposide (100 mg/m2/day on day 0–4) and either rhG-CSF (10 μg/kg/day vs. 5 μg/kg/day, CCG-0894, 71 patients), PIXY321 (500–1,000 μg/m2/day, CCG-0924, 14 patients), or rhG-CSF (5 μg/kg/day) and IL-6 (2.5–5 μg/kg/day, CCG-0931, 12 patients). Results Ninety-seven patients were evaluable for tumor response, 56 male and 41 female, median age 14.1 years (range 2.8–22.5 years). Tumor types were osteosarcoma (OTS) (n = 34), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 27), Ewing sarcoma (EWS) (n = 21), soft tissue sarcoma-not otherwise specified (n = 5), undifferentiated sarcoma (n = 6), fibrosarcoma (n = 2), peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1), and extraosseous Ewing (n = 1). The ORR was 51\% (27\% complete response [CR]). OS at 1 and 2 years was 49\% and 28\%, respectively. Patients with CR or partial response (PR) had significantly increased 1- and 2-year OS, 71\% and 41\%, respectively, (P < 0.001). Rhabdomyosarcoma patients with embryonal histology had significant improvement in 1- and 2-year OS: 82\% and 46\%, respectively, compared with other histologies, (P < 0.005). Conclusions The ORR to ICE reinduction chemotherapy in children with recurrent/refractory sarcoma was 51\%. OS of 1 and 2 years appeared significantly improved in patients who had CR or PR following ICE reinduction therapy or who had rhabdomyosarcoma with embryonal histology. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = { PURPOSEThe tolerance of escalating targeted doses of carboplatin combined with ifosfamide (IFOS)/etoposide (VP-16) (ICE) was assessed in children with recurrent solid tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODSTo reduce interpatient variability in carboplatin systemic exposure, 45 children were treated with doses individualized to a target area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) based on renal function, using technetium 99-diethyl-enetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) clearance to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Cohorts of at least three patients received carboplatin at an initial target AUC of 2 mg/mL x min, with escalations of 1 mg/mL x min in subsequent cohorts. Courses consisted of carboplatin on day 1 followed by IFOS 2 g/m2 plus VP-16 100 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3. Patients received at least two courses, with a maximum of eight courses possible in the absence of progressive disease. When only moderate toxicity occurred after escalation to 5 mg/mL x min, a third dose of IFOS plus VP-16 was added. After three patients were treated at this level, carboplatin escalation proceeded. RESULTSNeutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the dominant toxicities in the 43 assessable patients. At the target AUC of 8 mg/mL x min, 13 of 20 cycles were associated with febrile neutropenia. For phase II trials, we recommend a carboplatin target AUC of 6 mg/mL x min with three doses of IFOS and VP-16 for patients with prior craniospinal irradiation or high-dose cisplatin (CDDP)/VP-16, or 7 mg/mL x min for patients without such histories. There were two complete responses (CRs), 13 partial responses (PRs), and 17 objective responses (ORs).CONCLUSIONThe ICE regimen shows promising activity in pediatric solid tumors. The clear relationship between hematologic toxicity and carboplatin systemic exposure supports the use of targeted dosing in further trials of ICE chemotherapy.}

abstract = {Abstract Background Therapeutic trials using ifosfamide,carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) regimen have suggested many patients with refractory/relapsed solid tumors may be rendered free of disease using this combination. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, response and toxicity of this regimen in a Brazilian Pediatric Oncology Centre. Procedure ICE, consisting of ifosfamide 3 g/m2/day ×3 plus Mesna, etoposide 160 mg/m2/day ×3, and carboplatin 400 mg/m2/day ×2 was given at 21–28 days intervals. G-CSF was used for patients with hematological recovery greater than 4 weeks. Results Twenty-one patients younger than 18 years of age treated with this regimen were studied between July 1996 and November 2000. A total of 93 courses of ICE were administered. Leucopenia/neutropenia grades 3/4 were the most frequent severe adverse effects (82\%). Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 73\% of cycles, and anemia was common (61\%). The most common grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities were fever and proved infection occurring in 25\% and 14\% of the courses, respectively. Two patients developed renal tubular damage. Other less common grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities included nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, and stomatitis. The overall response rate (complete response/partial response) was 53\%. The median progression-free interval was 15.3 months, with a median survival of 24.2 months. Conclusions Although ICE was associated with severe myelosuppression it produced objective response in about half of the cases. The most important non-hematological toxicity was severe renal tubular damage. This regimen should only be used whenever hematological and infectious supportive care is available. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND: The authors report a retrospective analysis of high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (HD-ICE) for patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma (NB). A major reason for using this regimen was the long time since patients received previous treatment with a platinum compound. The authors also summarized the published experience on ICE in patients with NB. METHODS: Treatment comprised ifosfamide (2000 mg/m2 daily for 5 days), carboplatin (500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days), and etoposide (100 mg/m2 daily for 5 days). Patients who had poor hematologic reserve (platelet count <100,000/μL) from previous therapy received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after HD-ICE. Disease status before and after HD-ICE was defined according to International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (expanded to include 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine findings). Publications that were informative about ICE for NB were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients received 92 cycles of ICE, including 37 patients who received PBSC rescue. Grade 3 toxicities were rare: 1–3 patients had encephalopathy, mucositis, or gastroenteritis. Bacteremia was documented in 24 of 92 cycles (26\%). The absolute neutrophil count reached 500/μL on day 17–30 (median, day 22) in patients who had satisfactory hematologic reserve. Disease regressions (major and minor responses) were achieved by 14 of 17 patients (82\%) with a new relapse, 13 of 26 patients (50\%) with refractory NB, and 12 of 34 patients (35\%) who were treated for progressive disease during chemotherapy (P = .005). In the literature, patients received ICE at lower dosages and achieved major response rates >36\% in phase 1 and 2 studies (in which less comprehensive staging evaluations were used) that involved resistant NB and >70\% in induction for newly diagnosed NB. CONCLUSIONS: HD-ICE is appealing as salvage treatment or consolidative therapy because of its anti-NB activity and the low risk of major nonhematologic toxicity. PBSC support is unnecessary for patients who had intact hematologic reserve. Cancer 2013. © 2012 American Cancer Society.},

    abstract = { One hundred twenty-four children and young adults with recurrent tumors, predominantly sarcomas, were treated with the combination of ifosfamide, etoposide, and the uroprotector, mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulphonate), in a phase II trial. The treatment regimen consisted of 12 cycles of therapy administered every 3 weeks. After evaluation of the tumor response to chemotherapy alone, radiation or surgery was used to eradicate residual sites of metastatic disease where possible. At the present time, 77 patients are evaluable for response to the chemotherapy; 43 of the patients have experienced a significant reduction in the tumor size in response to the chemotherapy alone (39 partial responses [PR] and four complete responses [CR]). Sixteen of 17 patients with Ewing's sarcoma, nine of 13 with rhabdomyosarcoma, four of eight with peripheral neuroepithelioma, three of eight with osteosarcoma, and 11 of 31 with other tumors have responded with a PR or CR. The toxicity of the regimen was acceptable. Moderate or severe toxicity evaluated on a per cycle basis included: neutropenia, 97\%; thrombocytopenia, 32\%; nephrotoxicity, less than 1\%; mucositis, 1\%; neurologic toxicity, 2\%; nausea and vomiting, 13\%; hemorrhagic cystitis, less than 1\%. Fever was present after 33\% of cycles and sepsis following 7\%. One patient died due to sepsis and pancytopenia. At the present time, only seven of the 43 patients who responded to the chemotherapy regimen have relapsed, with a median follow-up of 10 weeks after the response. This drug combination is highly active in the treatment of recurrent sarcomas and other tumors in children and young adults. }

Children without gross nodular seeding in the subarachnoid space (M0 − M1) had better survival rates than children with gross nodular seeding (M2 − M3). Improved survival rates were observed by increasing the dose of radiation to the posterior fossa. Among children who had similar surgery, those who had T1 − T2 tumors fared better than those with TP3 − T4 tumors. The short term (up to 4.5 years) survival rates were better for older children but younger children had better long term survival rates. The posterior fossa was involved in 59% of children who developed recurrent tumor; however, in 75% of the recurrent cases either the posterior fossa was not involved or concomitant involvement of another site also was present."

    abstract = { Purpose The impact of adding vinblastine to a 4-month chemotherapy regimen, based on the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster 90 protocol, in childhood high-risk anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) was assessed. Patients and Methods Children and adolescents with high-risk ALCL, defined by mediastinal, lung, liver, spleen, or skin involvement, were eligible for the trial. After a prephase and one chemotherapy course, patients were randomly assigned to receive either five further chemotherapy courses without vinblastine or the same regimen with one vinblastine injection (6 mg/m2) during each course followed by weekly vinblastine to complete a total of 1 year of treatment. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS), analyzed on the intent-to-treat population. Results Between November 1999 and June 2006, 110 patients were randomly assigned to receive vinblastine, and 107 were randomly assigned not to receive vinblastine. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. Patients in the vinblastine arm had a significantly reduced risk of events during the first year (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.67; P = .002) followed by an increased risk thereafter (HR = 4.98; 95\% CI, 1.65 to 15.0; P = .003). Consequently, EFS at 1 year differed significantly (91\% in the vinblastine group v 74\% in the no-vinblastine group), with no difference at 2 years (73\% and 70\%, respectively). Overall EFS curves did not differ significantly (HR = 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.55 to 1.5; P = .71). Thirty-one percent of weekly doses of vinblastine were reduced as a result of hematologic toxicity, although vinblastine was discontinued for toxicity in only three patients. Conclusion Adding vinblastine during induction and as maintenance for a total treatment duration of 1 year significantly delayed the occurrence of relapses but did not reduce the risk of failure. }

    abstract = { Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of vinblastine for relapsed/refractory anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Patients and Methods Data were reviewed on all 36 patients included prospectively in the French database for pediatric ALCL who were treated with vinblastine (6 mg/m2/wk) for resistant primary disease (one), a first relapse (15), or subsequent relapses (20). Fifteen patients had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) for a previous relapse. Results Six patients were not evaluable for response, 25 (83\%) of 30 evaluable patients achieved a complete remission (CR), and five experienced progressive disease. Among the 31 patients who achieved a CR with vinblastine or before its initiation, six patients were treated with HSCT and 25 with vinblastine alone (median duration, 14 months). Overall, nine of 25 patients treated with vinblastine alone have remained in CR (median, 7 years since the end of treatment), and 16 patients have relapsed. Vinblastine was still efficient for subsequent relapses. With a median follow-up of 9.2 years, 12 patients have died (four as a result of toxicity after HSCT and eight as a result of disease), and 24 patients are alive (15 following treatment with single-agent vinblastine for the last event). Five-year overall survival is 65\% (95\% CI, 48\% to 79\%), and 5-year event-free survival is 30\% (95\% CI, 17\% to 47\%). Conclusion Vinblastine is highly efficient in relapsed ALCL and may produce durable remissions. The optimal treatment duration still has to be assessed. These results should be borne in mind when designing future phase II studies with the targeted therapies directed against anaplastic lymphoma kinase. }

ABSTRACT={Abstract
Introduction: Craniopharyngioma of childhood are commonly cystic in nature. An intracystic catheter insertion and subsequent instillation of substances inducing cyst shrinkage seems a beneficial strategy avoiding additional morbidity in a highly vulnerable brain location. Methods: A systematic review of the medical literature was performed to identify potentially relevant, all languages articles using Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to July 2011 and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to 3rd quarter 2011. All references were examined for relevancy. Results: Of 142 unique references x referred to substances used for intracystic craniopharyngioma treatment. General aspects of intracystic catheter insertion as well as response rates, risks and outcomes of children treated with intracystic radio-isotopes, bleomycin and interferon are critically reviewed and an outline for potential future endeavours provided. Conclusions: Interferon seems currently the intracystic substance with the best benefit risk ratio. The authors advocate for consensus on prospective data collection and standardized intracystic treatment strategies to allow reliable comparisons and herewith optimize treatment and outcome.

    abstract = "{Craniopharyngiomas are frequent hypothalamo-pituitary tumors in children, presenting predominantly as cystic lesions. Morbidity from conventional treatment has focused attention on intracystic drug delivery, hypothesized to cause fewer clinical consequences. However, the efficacy of intracystic therapy remains unclear. We report the retrospective experiences of several global centers using intracystic interferon-alpha.European Société Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique and International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery centers were contacted to submit a datasheet capturing pediatric patients with cystic craniopharyngiomas who had received intracystic interferon-alpha. Patient demographics, administration schedules, adverse events, and outcomes were obtained. Progression was clinical or radiological (cyst reaccumulation, novel cysts, or solid growth).Fifty-six children (median age, 6.3 y) from 21 international centers were identified. Median follow-up from diagnosis was 5.1 years (0.3–17.7 y). Lesions were cystic (n = 22; 39\\%) or cystic/solid (n = 34; 61\\%). Previous progression was treated in 43 (77\\%) patients before interferon use. In such cases, further progression was delayed by intracystic interferon compared with the preceding therapy for cystic lesions (P = 0.0005). Few significant attributable side effects were reported. Progression post interferon occurred in 42 patients (median 14 mo; 0–8 y), while the estimated median time to definitive therapy post interferon was 5.8 (1.8–9.7) years.Intracystic interferon-alpha can delay disease progression and potentially offer a protracted time to definitive surgery or radiotherapy in pediatric cystic craniopharyngioma, yet demonstrates a favorable toxicity profile compared with other therapeutic modalities—important factors for this developing age group. A prospective, randomized international clinical trial assessment is warranted.}",

These recommendations were outlined at the First International Medical Symposium for ECD, comprised of a comprehensive group of international academicians with expertise in the pathophysiology and therapy of ECD. Detailed recommendations on the initial clinical, laboratory, and radiographic assessment of ECD patients are presented in addition to treatment recommendations based on critical appraisal of the literature and clinical experience.

abstract ={Rosai–Dorfman disease (RDD), juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), and Erdheim–Chester disease (ECD) are non-Langerhans cell (non-LCH) disorders arising from either a dendritic or a macrophage cell. RDD is a benign disorder that presents with massive lymphadenopathy, but can have extranodal involvement. In most cases, RDD is self-limited and observation is the standard approach. Treatment is restricted to patients with life-threatening, multiple-relapsing, or autoimmune-associated disease. JXG is a pediatric histiocytosis characterized by xanthomatous skin lesions that usually resolve spontaneously. In a minority of cases, systemic disease can occur and can be life threatening. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), as well as germline mutations in NF1 and NF2, have been reported in children with JXG. Recent whole-exome sequencing of JXG cases did not show the BRAF-V600E mutation, although 1 patient had PI3KCD mutation. ECD is an adult histiocytosis characterized by symmetrical long bone involvement, cardiovascular infiltration, a hairy kidney, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Central nervous system involvement is a poor prognostic factor. Interferon-α is the standard as front-line therapy, although cladribine and anakinra can be effective in a few refractory cases. More than one-half of ECD patients carry the BRAF-V600E mutation. Currently, >40 patients worldwide with multisystemic, refractory BRAF-V600E+ ECD have been treated with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, which was found to be highly effective. Other recurrent mutations of the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways have been described in ECD. These discoveries may redefine ECD, JXG, and LCH as inflammatory myeloid neoplasms, which may lead to new targeted therapies.},

abstract = "Background
Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to the development of benign lesions in different body organs, mainly in the brain, kidney, liver, skin, heart, and lung. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are characteristic brain tumors that occur in 10% to 20% of tuberous sclerosis complex patients and are almost exclusively related to tuberous sclerosis complex. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas usually grow slowly, but their progression ultimately leads to the occlusion of the foramen of Monro, with subsequent increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus, thus necessitating intervention. During recent years, secondary to improved understanding in the biological and genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis complex, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have been shown to be effective in the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, becoming an alternative therapeutic option to surgery.
Methods
In June 2012, an International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference was convened, during which an expert panel revised the diagnostic criteria and considered treatment options for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. This article summarizes the subpanel's recommendations regarding subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.
Conclusions
Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have been shown to be an effective treatment of various aspects of tuberous sclerosis complex, including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Both mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and surgery have a role in the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Various subependymal giant cell astrocytoma–related conditions favor a certain treatment."

This Phase II trial enrolled patients with complicated vascular anomalies to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with sirolimus for 12 courses; each course was defined as 28 days.METHODS: Treatment consisted of a continuous dosing schedule of oral sirolimus starting at 0.8 mg/m2 per dose twice daily, with pharmacokinetic-guided target serum trough levels of 10 to 15 ng/mL. The primary outcomes were responsiveness to sirolimus by the end of course 6 (evaluated according to functional impairment score, quality of life, and radiologic assessment) and the incidence of toxicities and/or infection-related deaths.RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were enrolled; 57 patients were evaluable for efficacy at the end of course 6, and 53 were evaluable at the end of course 12. No patient had a complete response at the end of course 6 or 12 as anticipated. At the end of course 6, a total of 47 patients had a partial response, 3 patients had stable disease, and 7 patients had progressive disease. Two patients were taken off of study medicine secondary to persistent adverse effects. Grade 3 and higher toxicities attributable to sirolimus included blood/bone marrow toxicity in 27\% of patients, gastrointestinal toxicity in 3\%, and metabolic/laboratory toxicity in 3\%. No toxicity-related deaths occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus was efficacious and well tolerated in these study patients with complicated vascular anomalies.

abstract = {Abstract Background The combination of vinblastine and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma xenografts through pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic mechanisms. This phase I study aimed to explore the safety and toxicity of this combination in pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors. Procedure Patients ≤21 years of age with recurrent/refractory solid tumors (including CNS) were eligible. Sirolimus was administered daily by mouth or nasogastric (NG) tube, with doses adjusted to achieve a target trough concentration of 10–15 ng/ml, with weekly intravenous vinblastine (dose escalated 4–6 mg/m2/dose according to 3 + 3 phase I design). Results Fourteen patients were enrolled (median age 8.7 years; range 2.3–19) of whom 12 were evaluable for toxicity and 11 for response. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 mucositis) at the highest vinblastine dose level. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. Dose-adjusted sirolimus trough concentrations were significantly lower in patients receiving drug via NG tube (1.50 ± 0.75 ng/ml/mg vs. 2.25 ± 1.07 ng/ml/mg for oral administration). Correlative biomarker analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in serum concentration of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR2) at 28 days compared to baseline consistent with inhibition of angiogenesis. One patient had a partial response and three had stable disease for more than 3 months. Conclusions The combination of mTOR inhibitor and vinblastine given over an extended continuous schedule is safe, associated with a reduction in circulating angiogenic factor (CAF) VEGFR2 and resulted in clinical responses. Future studies using the intravenously administered mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus are planned. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:128–133. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
